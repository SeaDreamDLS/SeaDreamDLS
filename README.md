- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @SeaDreamDLS 

- 👀 I'm looking to learn how to effectively 
use the tools on GitHub to create and refine 
apps that will help me better manage my 
Type 2 Diabetes🩸.
- 👨🏻‍🏫 I would like to find someone that is 
willing to teach me how to update my 
current NightScout app with security, etc.. 
     - 🙌🏻 This was my first time using GitHub 
or doing ANYTHING like this. I had NO 
idea what I was doing, but I'm proud to 
say... it ACTUALLY WORKS!
- 🙋🏻‍♀️ I am a TOTAL newbie (so please be 
gentle), but I'm also a quick study...with just 
a little assistance 🤏🏻.
